- make argv[0]-recognition of X/YModem work with program_name_transform.
- look into VMIN code: how to determine if it's usable (it isn't unter
  FreeBSD and NetBSD (might have changed) and possibly many other 
  system), and what is the max value?
  Anyway - we don't *need* it. It just reduced system load (but that's
  not a real problem - zmodem over a ISDN/modem link is not much load).
- an option to stop transmission if BPS falls under a certain rate
  would be nice (possibly like this: "if BPS < N for M minutes").
- an option to stop transmission at a certain time.
- getopt_long ...
- ANSIfy it.
- stop #including .c files. That's a lot of work.

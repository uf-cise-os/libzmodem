New in lrzsz-0.12b:

- lrz: remote command execution is disabled per default. This 
  fixes a major security hole.
- lrz now defaults to restricted mode.
- lrz has a more restricted mode in which creation of directories
  and invisible files is not allowed. See lrz.1 for more information.
- rz and sz now recognize x- or y-modem-mode even if named lsb or lsx 
  (instead of sb or sx).
- timeout code is enabled again, can be turned of with the -O option.
- PUBDIR is now optional. configure with --enable-pubdir=/path if you
  really want a public writeable directory (i don't, so the default
  is no such directory).
- turned to GNU autoconf.
- added timesync protocol extension by Peter Mandrella. See timesync.doc
  and the man pages for more information.
- added crash recovery (this is a really simple extension to the 
  receivers file opening code). Both lrz and lsz no have a -r switch
  to request resume of a former transfer.
- many major and minor performance hacks.
- new: 8K blocksize (a common extension in the DOS world). Turn on
  with the -8 option to lsz (lrz handles this automatically).

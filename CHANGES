0.10 - 4-15-94
--------------
	Made a bunch of changes to the last public domain rzsz release to
make progress reports look pretty under various communications packages. 
Most mods are to lrz.c and lsz.c to give only a reasonable amount of
information while a transfer occurs.  

0.11 - 4-17-94
--------------
	Whoops.  Changed the location of 'rzlog' (the logfile) to /var/adm
instead of /tmp to meet the requirements of the Linux FSSTD.  Also fixed the
Makefile so it uses relative links we don't confuse oddly configured
systems.  Included the GNU General Public License for convenience.

To Do
-----
	Tk interface for progress reporting under X11.

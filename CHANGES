0.10 - 4-15-94
--------------
	Made a bunch of changes to the last public domain rzsz release to
make progress reports look pretty under various communications packages. 
Most mods are to lrz.c and lsz.c to give only a reasonable amount of
information while a transfer occurs.  

0.11 - 4-17-94
--------------
	Whoops.  Changed the location of 'rzlog' (the logfile) to /var/adm
instead of /tmp to meet the requirements of the Linux FSSTD.  Also fixed the
Makefile so it uses relative links we don't confuse oddly configured
systems.  Included the GNU General Public License for convenience.

To Do
-----
	Tk interface for progress reporting under X11.

0.11 to 0.12a 
-------------
- disabled log file code in rz.c and sz.c
- added timing code / transfer rate calculation to rz.c and sz.c
  (new code in timing.c)


0.12b - 5-26-96 to 6-2-96 Uwe Ohse <uwe@tirka.gun.de> 

- lrz.c: Restricted mode now defaults to 1. To turn off restricted
  mode use -U. Use -R to disable creation of directories and 
  invisible files.
  If $ZMODEM_RESTRICTED is found Restricted mode defaults to 2
  (no creation of directories and invisible files), but can still
  be reset through -U (whoever gives the options is also able
  to set/unset environment variables).
  Turning of restricted mode is impossible if running under
  a restricted shell.
  Remote command execution is disabled in restricted mode.
- lsz.c: Restricted mode is turned on if running under a restricted
  shell, or -R is given, or $ZMODEM_RESTRICTED is set. 
  With -U restricted mode is turned off unless running under a
  restricted shell.
- lrz.c: exitcode in main() was not initialized.
- lsz.c: missing break statement after -r option added (sz). -r implied
  -q, this is certainly not needed.
- lsz.c: threw out TXBSIZE-code (stdio can do that better - without 
  TXBSIZE the benchmarks give better results). Only lossage:
  can't seek on pipes anymore (but that didn't work with large buffers
  and long delays or really fast lines anyway).
- lsz.c: use mmap if possible.
- lrz.c: zmputs used to write a string in single byte writes. Changed
  that ...
- lrz.c, lsz.c: now recognize x- or y-modem-mode even if named lsb or lsx 
  (instead of sb or sx).
  ### TODO: make that work with program_transform_name.
- lrz.c: increased HOWMANY to 8192 (255, if NFGVMIN is not defined)
- lrz.c: added a missing error message.
- lrz.c, lsz.c: reenabled timeout code, can be disabled with the
  -O option.
- lsz.c, lrz.c: added timesync protocol extension by Peter Mandrella
  (can be totally disabled with configure --disable-timesync). if lrz is
  called with -S it will request a timesync packet and complain about
  larger differences if -v is given, if -S is given twice it will set
  the system time to the senders time (if running under root, oh well).
  lsz recognizes timesync protocoll only if -S is given
  (so timesync is normally disabled and doesn't introduce any 
  incompatabilities)
- lrz.c: added crash recovery (this is a really simple extension to the 
  receivers file opening code). Both lrz and lsz no have a -r switch
  to request resume of a former transfer.
- lrz.c: used putc to write the data to disk. changed that to fwrite.
- lrz.c: now removes the received file if fclose() failed.
- lrz.c/lsz.c: reduced number of outputs to stderr (progress/BPS-rate was 
  printed far too often and reduced the performance).
- lrz.c/lsz.c: added option -O: "disable timeout/SIGALRM handling". 
  This should increase performance significantly, and, on the other
  hand, makes l[sr]z wait forever (until it is interrupted/killed).
  Anyway: Even without -O performance is good enough. 280KB/sec
  through TCP/IP (localhost). -O gives about 290KB/sec.
- lrz.c/lsz.c: implemented 8K blocksize (give lsz the -8 option to use
  it - it defaults to traditional 1K).
- lrz.c: reduced calls to readline() (too many function calls - now
  uses a macro call in zm.c).
- lsz.c: Option -c (sending commands to remote) disabled in 
  restricted mode.
- lsz.c, lrz.c: PUBDIR is now optional (i don't trust public writable
  directories).
- lrz.c, lsz.c: threw out substr() - strstr is available since ages.
- changed error recovery mode: old didn't ever increase block 
  sizes. new one gets far better performance if transmission is
  bad for only a short time.
- lrz.c, lsz.c: off_t is long long under FreeBSD, can't be printed
  with %ld.
- updated manpages.

- almost all Files: autoconf'd them.

- Makefile.in: largely rewritten, now mostly conforms to the 
  GNU standards (mostly: i don't know what i've forgotten).

- updated version number to 0.12b

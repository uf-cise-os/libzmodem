Hi.  This is Mike Gran's fork of jnavila's fork of Uwe Ohse's fork of
Chuck Forsberg's rzsz.

Mike Gran's fork focusses on removing old and non-Linux code and also
making it into a library that I can link into the BBS I wrote.

Mike Gran's fork lives at https://github.com/spk121/lrzsz

If, for some reason, you want to contact Mike, try
<mike@lonelycactus.com>.

jnavila's fork fixed up some problems with Hyperterm.

It lives at https://github.com/jnavila/lrzsz

---------------------------------------

uwe's original README begins below.  Beyond here, the "me" is uwe.

----------------------------------------

lrzsz is a X/Y/ZModem package built from the public-domain version of
Chuck Forsberg´s rzsz package. This package contains NO code from later
releases of rzsz which would preclude it from being released under the
GPL.
It has been heavily modified by me and others.

Please note that credit should be given to Chuck Forsberg (rzsz) and Stephen
Satchell/Satchell Evaluations (crc routines) for this package. Any later
modifications were minor and merely introduced to increase performance,
reliability or compatability.

There is a mailing list for lrzsz: <uwe-lrzsz@bulkmail.ohse.de>. 
To subscribe send a mail to <uwe-lrzsz-subscribe@bulkmail.ohse.de>.

I prefer to get bug reports sent using the `lrzszbug' shell script which
you can find in the `src' subdirectory (this script is not installed together
with the programs because i don't expect many bug reports). Nethertheless
you can still send bug reports to <bugs@bulkmail.ohse.de> as normal
electronic mails. Bugs received at this address may be forwarded to the
mailing list.

Please read:
- INSTALL for installation instructions
- NEWS for a list of major changes between the releases
- ChangeLog for the list of minor changes.
- AUTHORS and THANKS to see whom to thank for this package.
- README.cvs for informations about CVS access to the lrzsz sources.
- README.tests for information about how to do a self test
- README.systems for a list of systems lrzsz has been compiled
  and passed a simple self test under.

  [Note from Mike Gran: I pulled out lots of code, so README.systems
  is invalid.]


In case you want to report a successful build:
	make success

  [Note from Mike Gran: I (mike) removed the 'make success' target,
  because I don't think it works anymore.]

or
	make fastcheck && \
	sh systype | mail uwe-generic-counter@ohse.de
"sh systype" alone shows what data this script sends.

Uwe Ohse

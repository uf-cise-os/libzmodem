LIBZMODEM - a library that sends and receives via ZModem


Hi.  Mike Gran here.  This project, if and when complete, will be
a library that I can link to a program that will send and receive
files from stdout/stdin using the ZModem protocol.

This project is *PRE-ALPHA*.  It does not yet compile to a library
that can be used to provide ZModem transfer.

When complete, the API will be described in the rzsz.h header file.

It derives from the lrzsz project, which is code for executables that
send and receive files via XModem, YModem, or ZModem.  Specifically,
this is Mike Gran's fork of jnavila's fork of Uwe Ohse's fork of Chuck
Forsberg's rzsz.

To become a library, the rz and sz executables need to become linkable
libraries and to be modified in three ways.

* all logging and screen I/O need to be redirected
* all hard exits need to become error codes
* the operations need to become interruptable and restartable

Mike Gran's fork lives at https://github.com/spk121/libzmodem

If, for some reason, you want to contact Mike, try

jnavila's fork fixed up some problems with Hyperterm.

It lives at https://github.com/jnavila/lrzsz

---------------------------------------

uwe's original README begins below.  Beyond here, the "me" is uwe.

----------------------------------------

lrzsz is a X/Y/ZModem package built from the public-domain version of
Chuck Forsberg´s rzsz package. This package contains NO code from later
releases of rzsz which would preclude it from being released under the
GPL.
It has been heavily modified by me and others.

Please note that credit should be given to Chuck Forsberg (rzsz) and Stephen
Satchell/Satchell Evaluations (crc routines) for this package. Any later
modifications were minor and merely introduced to increase performance,
reliability or compatability.

There is a mailing list for lrzsz: <uwe-lrzsz@bulkmail.ohse.de>. 
To subscribe send a mail to <uwe-lrzsz-subscribe@bulkmail.ohse.de>.

I prefer to get bug reports sent using the `lrzszbug' shell script which
you can find in the `src' subdirectory (this script is not installed together
with the programs because i don't expect many bug reports). Nethertheless
you can still send bug reports to <bugs@bulkmail.ohse.de> as normal
electronic mails. Bugs received at this address may be forwarded to the
mailing list.

Please read:
- INSTALL for installation instructions
- NEWS for a list of major changes between the releases
- ChangeLog for the list of minor changes.
- AUTHORS and THANKS to see whom to thank for this package.
- README.cvs for informations about CVS access to the lrzsz sources.
- README.tests for information about how to do a self test
- README.systems for a list of systems lrzsz has been compiled
  and passed a simple self test under.

  [Note from Mike Gran: I pulled out lots of code, so README.systems
  is invalid.]


In case you want to report a successful build:
	make success

  [Note from Mike Gran: I (mike) removed the 'make success' target,
  because I don't think it works anymore.]

or
	make fastcheck && \
	sh systype | mail uwe-generic-counter@ohse.de
"sh systype" alone shows what data this script sends.

  [Note from Mike Gran: I (mike) removed the systype script,
  which could be approimated by calling 'uname -a'.]
